                "This class comprises the intellectual or artistic realisations of works in the form of identifiable immaterial objects, such as texts, poems, jokes, musical or choreographic notations, movement pattern, sound pattern, images, multimedia objects, or any combination of such forms that have objectively recognisable structures. The substance of F2 Expression is signs.\nExpressions cannot exist without a physical carrier, but do not depend on a specific physical carrier and can exist on one or more carriers simultaneously. Carriers may include human memory.\nInasmuch as the form of F2 Expression is an inherent characteristic of the F2 Expression, any change in form (e.g., from alpha-numeric notation to spoken word, a poem created in capitals and rendered in lower case) is a new F2 Expression. Similarly, changes in the intellectual conventions or instruments that are employed to express a work (e.g., translation from one language to another) result in the creation of a new F2 Expression. Thus, if a text is revised or modified, the resulting F2 Expression is considered to be a new F2 Expression. Minor changes, such as corrections of spelling and punctuation, etc., are normally considered variations within the same F2 Expression. On a practical level, the degree to which distinctions are made between variant expressions of a work will depend to some extent on the nature of the F1 Work itself, and on the anticipated needs of users.\nThe genre of the work may provide an indication of which features are essential to the expression. In some cases, aspects of physical form, such as typeface and page layout, are not integral to the intellectual or artistic realisation of the work as such, and therefore are not distinctive criteria for the respective expressions. For another work, features such as layout may be essential. For instance, the author or a graphic designer may wrap a poem around an image.\nAn expression of a work may include expressions of other works within it. For instance, an anthology of poems is regarded as a work in its own right that makes use of expressions of the individual poems that have been selected and ordered as part of an intellectual process. This does not make the contents of the aggregated expressions part of this work, but only parts of the resulting expression.\nIf an instance of F2 Expression is of a specific form, such as text, image, etc., it may be simultaneously instantiated in the specific classes representing these forms in CIDOC CRM. Thereby one can make use of the more specific properties of these classes, such as language (which is applicable to instances of E33 Linguistic Object only).\n"@en ;

                "This class comprises activities that result in instances of F2 Expression coming into existence. This class characterises the externalisation of an Individual Work.\nAlthough F2 Expression is an abstract entity, a conceptual object, the creation of an expression inevitably also affects the physical world: when you scribble the first draft of a poem on a sheet of paper, you produce an instance of F4 Manifestation Singleton; F28 Expression Creation is a subclass of E12 Production because the recording of the expression causes a physical modification of the carrying E18 Physical Thing. The work becomes manifest by being expressed on a physical carrier different from the creator’s brain. The spatio-temporal circumstances under which the expression is created are necessarily the same spatio-temporal circumstances under which the first instance of F4 Manifestation Singleton is produced. The mechanisms through which oral tradition (of myths, tales, music, etc.) operates are not further investigated in this model. As far as bibliographic practice is concerned, only those instances of F2 Expression that are externalised on physical carriers other than both the creator’s brain and the auditor’s brain are taken into account (for a discussion of the modelling of oral traditions, see: Nicolas, Yann. ‘Folklore Requirements for Bibliographic Records: oral traditions and FRBR.’ In: Cataloging Classification Quarterly (2005). Vol. 39, No. 3-4. P. 179-195).\nIt is possible to use the P2 has type (is type of) property in order to specify that the creation of a given expression of a given work played a particular role with regard to the overall bibliographic history of that work (e.g., that it was the creation of the progenitor expression on which all other expressions of the same work are based; or that it was the creation of the critical edition that served as the basis for canonical references to the work).\n"@en ;

                "This class comprises parts of Expressions and these parts are not Self-Contained Expressions themselves.\nThe existence of an instance of F23 Expression Fragment can be due to accident, such as loss of material over time, e.g. the only remaining manuscript of an antique text being partially eaten by worms, or due to deliberate isolation, such as excerpts taken from a text by the compiler of a collection of excerpts.\nAn F23 Expression Fragment is only identified with respect to its occurrence in a known or assumed whole. The size of an instance of F23 Expression Fragment ranges from more than 99% of an instance of F22 Self-Contained Expression to tiny bits (a few words from a text, one bar from a musical composition, one detail from a still image, a two-second clip from a movie, etc.).\n"@en ;
