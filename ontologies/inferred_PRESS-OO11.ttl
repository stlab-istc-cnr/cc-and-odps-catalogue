                "This property associates an instance of Z12 Issuing Rule with a dimension foreseen for exemplars of the issues of a serial that follows that policy.\nTypically, this property is observed on one exemplar of an issue of a serial, and extrapolated to all other exemplars of the issue and of other issues to come. This logical inference is an induction along the path that can be modelled as: F18 Serial Work Y37 has former or current issuing rule Z12 Issuing Rule, and F18 Serial Work R10 has member F19 Publication Work R3 is realised in F24 Publication Expression R6i is carried by F5 Item P39i was measured by E16 Measurement P40 observed dimension E54 Dimension.

                "This class comprises plans that specify bits of the issuing policy followed at some point in time for instances of F18 Serial Work.\nThe notion of issuing policy may include: regularity, frequency, sequencing pattern, the language of the linguistic objects contained in each issue, dimension of each issue, the font used to print each issue, the layout and editorial rules adhered to in each issue, etc.\n[Note: The notion of issuing rule is to be understood differently in PRESSOO than in FRBROO. In FRBROO, property R11 has issuing rule (is issuing rule) points to a complete issuing policy that comprises a variety of parameters (regularity, frequency, dimension, language, etc.), while in PRESSOO an instance of Z12 Issuing Rule focuses on only one of those parameters and consists of a plan for just the expected regularity, just the expected frequency, just the expected dimension, etc. This perspective shift was made necessary when it was realized that any change (i.e., any instance of Z5 Issuing Rule Change) in just one of those parameters led to a new instantiation of Z12 Issuing Rule and new instantiations of all the ranges of the associated properties, with exactly the same value for each of them except for the one parameter that changes. It was deemed preferable to associate an instance of Z12 Issuing Rule with just one parameter of the issuing policy, which makes it possible that, e.g., a monthly was transformed into a quarterly without having to repeat that the expected language of its issues remains English.]"@en ;
