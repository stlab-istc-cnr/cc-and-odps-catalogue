                "An expression of a bibliographic record in a specific format, that references a particular textual or data publication (or a work in preparation for publication). Each bibliographic reference is a list of items containing entities that describe aspects of the referenced work - for example authors, title, journal, publication year - selected from the bibliographic record.  Note that because different journal styles may require omission of elements of the bibliographic record in references included in a paper's reference list (e.g. the title, the identifier, the names of the eighth and subsequent authors), and because errors can be introduced when an author creates a bibliographic reference, the bibliographic reference to a published work may not be a complete or fully accurate expression of the information contained within the authoritative bibliographic record for that work."@en ;

                "A record that uniquely describes a particular textual or data publication (or a work in preparation for publication). Each bibliographic record is a set of entities describing aspects of the referenced work, including, for example, but not restricted to: authors, title, journal, publication year, DOI, ISSN, publisher and copyright information, or, in the case of a data publication: creators, title, version, archive, publication year, DOI or other identifier). The FRBR expression of a bibliographic record is a bibliographic reference, which usually contains only a sub-set of these entities, ordered in a particular way that corresponds to the house style of the publication in which it occurs."@en ;
