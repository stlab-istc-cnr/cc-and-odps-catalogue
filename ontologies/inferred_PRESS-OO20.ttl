                "This class comprises activities that consist of publishing the latest known issue of a given continuing resource.\nAn instance of Z7 Ending of Publication is part of the instance of F30 Publication Event that realises the entire continuing resource, and it is associated with it through property P115 finishes (is finished by) (i.e., the ending point of the instance of Z7 Ending of Publication coincides with the ending point of the instance of F30 Publication Event).\nThis class and Z6 Starting of Publication are not declared as disjoint, as the publication of the first issue of a continuing resource can also be the publication of its latest known issue, in cases where only one issue of a continuing resource was ever published. If no other issue of a periodical is published after the first issue, then both the instance of Z6 Starting of Publication and the instance of Z7 Ending of Publication P114 [are] equal in time to the instance of F30 Publication Event. As a matter of fact, the same event is then an instance of all three classes."@en ;
