                "An expression of a bibliographic record in a specific format, that references a particular textual or data publication (or a work in preparation for publication). Each bibliographic reference is a list of items containing entities that describe aspects of the referenced work - for example authors, title, journal, publication year - selected from the bibliographic record.  Note that because different journal styles may require omission of elements of the bibliographic record in references included in a paper's reference list (e.g. the title, the identifier, the names of the eighth and subsequent authors), and because errors can be introduced when an author creates a bibliographic reference, the bibliographic reference to a published work may not be a complete or fully accurate expression of the information contained within the authoritative bibliographic record for that work."@en ;
