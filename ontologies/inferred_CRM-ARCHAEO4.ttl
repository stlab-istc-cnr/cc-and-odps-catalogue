                "This class comprises activities of excavating in the sense of archaeology which are documented as a coherent set of actions of progressively recording and removing matter from a pre-specified location under specific rules. Typically, an excavation process unit would be terminated if significant discontinuities of substance or finds come to light, or if the activity should be interrupted due to external factors, such as end of a working day. In other cases, the termination would be based on predefined physical specifications, such as the boundaries of a maximal volume of matter intended to be excavated in one unit of excavation.\nDepending on the methodology, an instance of A1 Excavation Process Unit may intend to remove matter only within the boundaries of a particular stratigraphic unit, or it may follow a pre-declared spatial extent such as a trench. It may only uncover, clean or expose a structure or parts of it.\nThe process of excavation results in the production of a set of recorded (documentation) data that should be sufficient to provide researchers enough information regarding the consistence and spatial distribution of the excavated Segment of Matter and things and features embedded in it. Some parts or all of the removed physical material (S11 Amount of Matter) may be dispersed, whereas others may be kept in custody in the form of finds or samples, while others (such as parts of walls) may be left at the place of their discovery. The data produced by an instance of excavation process unit should pertain to the material state of matter at excavation time only and should well be distinguished from subsequent interpretation about the causes for this state of matter.\n"@en ;

                "This class comprises coherent parts of the boundary surface, which appears as the result of a stratigraphic genesis event or process. The interface marks the extreme limit of the effect of a genesis or modification event, and indicates in particular where the effect of this event ended. Each event of creation/destruction of a deposition layer implies the creation of new interfaces. Thus there are two main types of interface: those that are surfaces of strata (that can be directly related to the corresponding stratum via the AP12 confines property), and those that are only surfaces, formed by the removal or destruction of existing stratifications."@en ;

                "This class comprises activities or processes that have produced homogeneous, distinguishable units of stratification that are in a relatively stable form from the time of their genesis until they are observed. Such processes may be the aggregation of cycles of erosion/destruction, deposit/accumulation, transformation/modification occurring on a particular site throughout a particular period of time. These processes are usually due not only to natural forces (i.e., climate, the impact of flora and fauna, other natural events), but also to human activities, in particular, excavation and construction. An event of stratification genesis typically produces two main forms of stratification units both a deposit and an interface."@en ;
