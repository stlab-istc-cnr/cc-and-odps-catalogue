                "A 'Reconstruction' is a specific modelling of one or several entities of type 'Observation' into a single resource. The prov:wasDerivedFrom property is used to indicate on which Observations a Reconstruction was based. \nIt is also possible to derrive a Reconstruction from other Reconstructions."@en ;

                "A Reconstruction is derived from one or several Observation(s) or Reconstruction(s). \nIt is good practise to also specify the activity in which the derivation was made. This can be done by modelling a `prov:qualifiedDerivation` on the Reconstruction in which the Activity, Agent and Plan can be specified."@en ;
