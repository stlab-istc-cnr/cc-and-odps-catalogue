                "This class comprises coherent parts of the boundary surface, which appears as the result of a stratigraphic genesis event or process. The interface marks the extreme limit of the effect of a genesis or modification event, and indicates in particular where the effect of this event ended. Each event of creation/destruction of a deposition layer implies the creation of new interfaces. Thus there are two main types of interface: those that are surfaces of strata (that can be directly related to the corresponding stratum via the AP12 confines property), and those that are only surfaces, formed by the removal or destruction of existing stratifications."@en ;

                "This class comprises activities or processes that have produced homogeneous, distinguishable units of stratification that are in a relatively stable form from the time of their genesis until they are observed. Such processes may be the aggregation of cycles of erosion/destruction, deposit/accumulation, transformation/modification occurring on a particular site throughout a particular period of time. These processes are usually due not only to natural forces (i.e., climate, the impact of flora and fauna, other natural events), but also to human activities, in particular, excavation and construction. An event of stratification genesis typically produces two main forms of stratification units both a deposit and an interface."@en ;
