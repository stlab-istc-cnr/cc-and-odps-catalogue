                "This class comprises activities performed by ISSN agencies (either at the international or a regional level) and consisting of exerting a responsibility on the metadata relating to a continuing resource identified by an ISSN, which includes, among other things: storing and preserving the metadata, checking the accuracy of the recorded information, making decisions as to whether new records and new ISSNs are required or not due to modifications in the continuing resource described, checking the uniqueness of key titles, etc. Z8 Metadata Management does not necessarily include the activity of creating the metadata.\nA set of ISSN metadata can be managed by various agencies over time, but at a given point in time it cannot be managed by more than one agency. In practice, information relating to the agency that was previously responsible for a given set of metadata is erased from that set of metadata when the responsibility on it is handed over to another agency.\n[Comment. This scope note is very restrictive and specific, while the label for the class is deliberately very vague and general. The intention is to make it possible in the future, if needed, to generalize this class and include it in other conceptual models.]"@en ;
